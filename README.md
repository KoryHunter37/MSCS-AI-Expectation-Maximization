# MSCS Project

This repository overviews an Artificial Intelligence design project which I completed while completing my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. The source code for this project is not publically available, in compliance with the Georgia Institute of Technology Academic Honor Code<sup><a href="https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code">[1]</a></sup>.

Instead, I have substituted my raw code with a guided walkthrough of the project itself, the steps I went through to complete it, and the skills I acquired by solving it.

# Overview

Automatic image processing is a key component to many AI systems, including facial recognition and video compression. One basic method for processing is segmentation, by which one divides an image into a fixed number of components in order to simplify its representation. For example, I can train a mixture of Gaussians to represent an image, and segment it according to the simplified representation as shown in the images below.
